# Task Control Hub

Task Control Hub is a right-sidebar dashboard for managing all tasks across your Obsidian vault.

## Features

- Scans the entire vault for Markdown checklist tasks (`- [ ] ...`)
- Inline editing of **Status**, **Priority**, and **Due Date**
- Color-coded status (Open, In Progress, Complete, Canceled)
- Filters:
  - Status: All / Open / In Progress / Complete / Canceled
  - Priority: All / High / Medium / Low
  - Due: All / Today / This Week / Overdue
- Sort by: Created Date, Due Date, Priority, Status
- Respects Obsidian wiki-links – `[[Note Names]]` render and open as normal links
